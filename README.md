### This is the work for JiangFeiyu_Siemens_Interview.
#### Document descriptionï¼š
1. There are four files in total corresponding to 4 Tasks. Each file stores the answer to a Task. Python code is stored in `TaskList.ipynb`. The file is already compiled. Other answers is saved as `markdown` file.
2. For parts that involve data reading (such as `Fuse.csv`, `Training_part1.csv`, and `Training_part2.csv`), please store the original data and code in the same path.
3. The Bash file is stored separately as attachment.
4. The problem source: https://github.com/KevinKillsap/Siemens/wiki/Task-for-Junior-DS
5. I encountered some problems in Q2 and Q3 of the Task List. For Q2, I don't know how to deal with the ML model, so I just wrote down some of my flow. For Q3, I didn't clearly understand the question and I didn't find the file under the code.
